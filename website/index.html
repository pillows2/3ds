<p><h6><font size="2"><p style="width:30%">Custom Firmware is the 3DS equivellent of Jailbreak or Root on a mobile device. It exists because of oversights or errors in the existing code. Now, please not that we didn't always have Custom Firmware, or even userland homebrew access at all. When the 3DS was released in 2011 several people (including me) were wondering what, other than games, the console could do. Starting in late 2011 we started at least getting tools.</p></font></p>

<p><h6><font size="2"><p style="width:30%">In December 2011 the first 3DS tools were released. They were all programs that could record video in the stereoscopic 3D that the 3DS utilizes. In 2012 the first real homebrew was starting to develop. A tool that could create app icons and banners was released. Then later that year, the first (un-launchable) homebrew released. It was called "Hello World" and, you guessed it... prints the text "Hello World." Note that I said un-launchable, as there was no homebrew access point... yet.</p></font></p>

<p><h6><font size="2"><p style="width:30%">2013 was the real beginning..</p></font></p>
